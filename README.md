## üìã Executive Summary

**Business Question:** Should we ship the new pricing page (Variant B) to improve conversions and revenue?

**Bottom Line:**  
Variant B demonstrates a statistically significant improvement 


---

## üéØ Experiment Overview

**üß™ Hypothesis:**  
Variant B (new pricing page) will reduce friction in the signup flow and increase conversions.

**üìå Setup:**
- Duration: 25 days (May 1‚Äì25, 2025)  
- Sample Size: 15,000 users (split 50/50)  
- Primary Metric: Conversion Rate (CVR)  
- Secondary Metrics: CTR, ARPU, Plan Mix  

**üë• Segments:**
- Students (45%)  
- Professionals (35%)  
- Teachers (20%)  

**üì≤ Traffic Sources:**
- Web (50%), Mobile (30%), Social (15%), Email (5%)

**üí≥ Plan Types:**
- Basic ($99), Pro ($199), Enterprise ($499)

## üî¨ Statistical Significance Testing

**Methods Used:**
- ‚úÖ Chi-square tests for conversion rate  
- ‚úÖ Welch's t-tests for revenue  
- ‚úÖ Effect size & confidence intervals  

**Thresholds:**
- Œ± = 0.05 (95% confidence)  
- Power > 80%  
- Minimum Effect Size > 5%

**Why It Matters for PMs:**  
Avoiding false positives and quantifying practical impact ensures better prioritization and justifies implementation costs.
